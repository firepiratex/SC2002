# Welcome to Group 5's Hospital Management System (HMS)!
## About
This is a project for SC2002 (Object-Oriented Design & Programming) which is a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application which aims at automating the management of hospital operations, including patient management, appointment scheduling, staff management, and billing. The system is expected to facilitate efficient management of hospital resources, enhance patient care, and streamline administrative processes.

## Lessons Learned
We learn to appreciate the Object-Oriented concepts together with SOLID design principles. By designing using SOLID, whenever changes needed to be made in a project, we could easily do so with minimal impact. We learn about how to divide and conquer a task efficiently. From the sheer amount of code we have to contribute, we also became more fluent and confident in Java programming, which would benefit us in future programming courses.
