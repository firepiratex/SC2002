## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Run

The jar file for this project is under `SC2002/HMS/HMS.jar`.
There is a script file called `HMS.bat`.
This script helps you to change to the current directory and run the `java -jar HMS.jar` command to execute the jar file.
